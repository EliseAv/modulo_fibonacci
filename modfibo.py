Modulo Fibonacci
================

Usage: ``python modfibo.py [BASE]``
E.g.:  ``python modfibo.py 16``

So you know the Fibonacci sequence, right? It's 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 and so on. After going on the sequence for a
while, I noticed that the least significant digit is a pretty long sequence that should eventually start repeating, but
it was taking way too long. So I started analyzing that particular angle of the sequence (modulo 10); yes, on paper. For
some strange reason I had so much fun with it that I started doing it for other bases: hex, oct, 7, 6, 5â€¦ And when I got
home I wrote this little test app to explore bigger bases. Base 11 was really hard to do on paper.

There is no purpose to this. It's just fun with numbers. Either you get it or you're not a nerd, and either way is fine.
